Just generated extract_vitals.m using codegen. Link extract_vitals.dll into Python code. See example main at src/matlab/codegen/dll/extract_vitals/example. Try:
  It's very easy to call a DLL function in Python. I have a self-made DLL file with two functions: add and sub which take two arguments.
    add(a, b) returns addition of two numbers
    sub(a, b) returns substraction of two numbers
  The name of the DLL file will be "demo.dll"
  Program:
    from ctypes import*
    # give location of dll
    mydll = cdll.LoadLibrary("C:\\demo.dll")
    result1= mydll.add(10,1)
    result2= mydll.sub(10,1)
    print "Addition value:-"+result1
    print "Substraction:-"+result2

Running into ELF header error
  Try downloading python 64bit onto TK1.
  If that doesn't work, may need to put Matlab on TK1 and use Coder to build it natively :( Or try setting up mingw properly for matlab
